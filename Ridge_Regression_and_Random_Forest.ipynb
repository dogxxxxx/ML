    "In this question, you will train a random forest for predicting over the validation data. Use cross-validation over the validation data to select the best set of paramaters for the random forest regressor. Parameters to include in your exploration are **n_estimators**, **max_features** and **max_samples**. Use `np.linspace` or `np.logspace` to define ranges of values to explore for each parameter and create a grid to be assessed over the validation data. Make sure you use the same validation data that was given to you.\n",
